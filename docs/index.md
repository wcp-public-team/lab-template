# Welcome to the Lab Template

This repo can be used as a starting point for new labs.  It leverages [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to generate static HTML that can be published to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

You are currently viewing the github pages site for this repo.  To see the actual repo click on the Github link in the lower left corner of the browser, at the bottom of the left navigation menu.

!!! note
    This is an example of a component of the admonition extension.  You can learn more about options for this component [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/).

!!! tip
    This is what a markdown link looks like:

    ```
    [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
    ```

    This link renders like this:  [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)

    One of the issues with markdown is that it does not support links that open in new windows or tabs.  Markdown does support regular HTML, so you could also do that same link like this:

    ```
    <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org" target="_blank">MKDocs</a>
    ```

    This one renders like this: <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org" target="_blank">MKDocs</a>
